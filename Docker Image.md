A **Docker Image** is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a **Docker container**.

A Docker image includes everything needed to run an application, including the application code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Images are created using a Dockerfile, which is a text file that defines the steps needed to build the image.


### Image vs Container

Image is the actual **package/artifact** (containing the application code and everything needed to run it). 

A container is an instance of that image running in an isolated environment. A **container** is a running enviroment for **image**.
