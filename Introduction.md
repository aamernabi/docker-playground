What is **Docker**?

**Docker** is a popular **containerization** platform that allows you to package your applications along with their dependencies into a single container, which can be easily deployed and run on any platform that supports Docker.

In other words, Docker allows you to create a lightweight, portable, and self-contained environment for your application, which can be run on any machine with Docker installed, without having to worry about installing and configuring dependencies or dealing with compatibility issues.

**Docker** uses a client-server architecture and is built on top of Linux container technology. It provides a simple and consistent way to build, ship, and run your applications in containers, which can be managed and orchestrated using tools like Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
